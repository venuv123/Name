# Project - Aadhaar Enrolment

[Aadhaar Enrolment](https://uidai.gov.in/enrolment-update/aadhaar-enrolment.html) is an initiative by the India Government to register their citizens. As India has over a billion people, keeping track of residents is a major problem.

## Project Overview

In this project we're going to create a python script that can perform queries on the [Aadhaar Enrolment](https://uidai.gov.in/enrolment-update/aadhaar-enrolment.html) data set, such as:

* Query residents By State
* Query residents by District
* Query residents by Gender
